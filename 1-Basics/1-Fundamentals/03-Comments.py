# Python Comments
# ---------------
# Comments are used to explain Python code.
# Comments can make your code more readable.
# Comments can be used to prevent execution of code.

# Single-line comments start with a hash symbol (#)

# This is a comment
print("Hello, world!")  # This is an inline comment

# You can use comments to explain what the code does
name = "Alice"  # Storing the user's name
print("Welcome,", name)  # Display a welcome message

# Multi-line comments:
# Python does not have a specific syntax for multi-line comments.
# However, you can use multiple single-line comments like this
# to explain things over several lines.

"""
Alternatively, you can use a multi-line string (triple quotes)
as a comment, even though it's technically a string and not a comment.
It's often used as a block comment or docstring.

"""
This is a block of text
used as a multi-line comment.
Python will ignore it if it's not assigned to a variable or used as a docstring.
