# Python Indentation
# -------------------
# Indentation (Very Important!)
# Refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line.
# In other programming languages, indentation is for readability only.
# But in Python, indentation is very important.
# Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.
# Python uses indentation instead of braces {} to define blocks of code.

# Correct indentation
if True:
    print("This is indented properly")

# Incorrect indentation (will throw an error)
# if True:
# print("This will cause an IndentationError")

# Incorrect indentation (will throw an IndentationError)
# print("Hello In Python Course")
#  print("Hello world !")

# Correct syntax using proper indentation
print("Correct Syntax")
print("correct Syntax")
print("Correct Syntax")
print("Correct Syntax respecting indentation syntax")

# Don't worry about the code logic, just focus on the correct indentation.
# (We will learn about if conditions soon)
if 5 > 2:
    print("Five is greater than two!")
