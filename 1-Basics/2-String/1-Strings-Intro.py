# String Introduction
# -------------------
# Strings in python are surrounded by either single quotation marks, or double quotation marks.
# 'hello' is the same as "hello".
# You can display a string literal with the print() function:

# Example

print("Hello")
print('Hello')
# Quotes Inside Quotes
# You can use quotes inside a string, as long as they don't match the quotes surrounding the string:
# Example
print("It's alright")
print("He is called 'Johnny'")
print('He is called "Johnny"')

# Assign String to a Variable
# Assigning a string to a variable is done with the variable name followed by an equal sign and the string:
# Example

a = "Enjoy Coding with Python"
print(a)
# Multiline Strings
# You can assign a multiline string to a variable by using three quotes:
a = """This Not comment this a string and you can single '  Quotes or double Quotes insd it without any problem """
print(a)
