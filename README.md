# Python Introduction
Python is a powerful, easy-to-learn programming language that's used in everything from web development and automation to data science and artificial intelligence. Its simple and readable syntax makes it one of the best choices for beginners, while still being powerful enough for professionals to build complex systems.
Whether you're just getting started in programming or expanding your skills after learning JavaScript, Python is a language that will open many doors in your software journey.

- Automation
## Good to know
- The most recent major version of Python is Python 3.12.1, which we shall be using in this Course. However, Python 2, 
although not being updated with anything other than security updates, is still quite popular.
- In this tutorial, Python will be written in a EDI(Integrated 
  Development Environment). It is possible to write Python in an Text Editor such as VS Code.
# Getting Started
## 🛠️ Installing Python
Before you can run Python code, you need to make sure Python is installed on your machine.
To check if you have python installed on a Windows PC, search in the start bar for Python or run the following on the Command Line (cmd.exe):
1. 🔎 Step 1: Check if Python is Already Installed
```shell
C:\Users\Your Name>python --version
```
To check if you have python installed on a Linux or Mac, then on linux open the command line or on Mac open the Terminal and type:
```shell
python --version
```
**✅ If Python is installed, you'll see something like:**
```shell
Python 3.12.1
```
❌ If you see an error like "command not found" or "'python' is not recognized", it means Python is not installed or not added to the system PATH.
2. 💻 Step 2: Install Python
**For Windows:**
Go to the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/
Download the latest version for Windows.
Run the installer.
✅ IMPORTANT: During installation, check the box that says:
Add Python to PATH
Click "Install Now".
**For macOS:**
You can use Homebrew if you’re comfortable with the terminal:
```shell
brew install python
```
**🐧 For Linux (Debian/Ubuntu):**
```shell
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3
```
**Step 3: Verify the Installation**
After installation, open your terminal or command prompt and type.
```shell
python --version
#Or 
python3 --version
```
## 🧪 Bonus: Try Python in the Terminal
To test a short amount of code in python sometimes it is quickest and easiest not to write the code in a file. This is made possible because Python can be run as a command line itself.
Type the following on the Windows, Mac or Linux command line:
```shell
>>> print("Hello, Python!")
Hello, Python!
```
